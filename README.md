## üöÄ How It Works

The application is architected around two core functionalities powered by the Google Gemini API:

1.  **Disease Information Retrieval**: When a user searches for a disease, the application constructs a highly specific prompt asking the `gemini-2.5-flash` model for a structured summary. The model's text response is then parsed and elegantly formatted into distinct sections for readability.

2.  **News Aggregation with Grounding**: The "Fetch Latest News" feature leverages the `googleSearch` tool available in the Gemini API. This grounds the model's response in real-time search results from the web, allowing it to generate current and accurate news headlines. The application then extracts both the generated text and the `groundingChunks` (source URLs and titles) from the API response to present to the user.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

This project is designed to run in an environment where the Google Gemini API key is securely managed.

### Prerequisites

-   A valid Google Gemini API key set as an environment variable (`process.env.API_KEY`).
-   A modern web browser.

### Running the Application

1.  **No Installation Needed**: The project uses an `importmap` in `index.html` to load React and the `@google/genai` library directly from a CDN. There are no local `node_modules` to install.
2.  **Serve the Files**: Serve the `index.html` file using a simple local web server. A tool like `serve` or a VS Code extension like "Live Server" can be used.
3.  **Open in Browser**: Navigate to the local server's address in your web browser to use the application.

The application logic is contained entirely within `index.tsx`, which is loaded as an ES module by the `index.html` file.
